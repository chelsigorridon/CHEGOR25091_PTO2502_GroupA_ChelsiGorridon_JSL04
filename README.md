# JSL04 Project: Dynamic Task Display & Modal View Kanban App 

---

## What is a Dynamic Task Display & Modal View? :
A Dynamic Task Display means your tasks are generated and shown using JavaScript, based on data , instead of being hardcoded into your HTML.
A modal is a popup window that appears on top of your page to focus the user on one specific task or input.
I'll be implenting this to my Kanban App.
